## Workflow
Branch Naming Conventions
Branch names should follow the following convention:

< jira-ticket > - < feature-description >

Bugfix branches should make it clear that it is a bugfix branch using bugfix/

Pull Requests should also be named with < jira-ticket > at the front. For example, 'MW-1 Fix bug'

## Merge Strategies
No work directly on main will be committed. Instead, all features and bug fixes are to be merged into the develop branch using a pull request. Once reviewed by one other team member, changes are merged into the master branch for release.

## Docs
Documentation for the project is available in the docs folder of the repository. These documents are linked from Confluence.
